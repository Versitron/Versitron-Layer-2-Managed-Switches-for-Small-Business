## Layer 2 Managed Switches for Small Business

**Trusted connectivity and control for your business LAN.**

- Fully managed Layer 2 switch capability — supports IEEE 802.1Q VLAN, QoS, link aggregation and SNMP monitoring.  
- Easy web‑based management interface for intuitive configuration of business network segments.   
- Compact models available with gigabit ports and optional fiber uplinks — suited for small office, retail, and branch‑office environments.   
- Ideal for small business networks that require **managed switches** to segment traffic, prioritize applications, and centralize monitoring.

## Port Mirroring Switch for Cyber Security

**Visibility and control for network monitoring and threat detection.**

- Supports port mirroring (SPAN) to copy traffic from one or more ports to a monitoring device — enabling intrusion detection, forensic analysis and security monitoring.   
- Enables VLAN, QoS and link‑aggregation features so you can isolate, tag and prioritise traffic flows for security purposes.   
- Suitable for use in security operations centres (SOCs), network monitoring segments, or branch networks that require detailed traffic analysis.  
- Perfect for organisations that need **managed switches** with advanced monitoring capability for cyber‑security compliance and active threat detection.

## 6‑Port Managed Switch for Industrial Automation

**Compact but full‑featured switch for factory or automation network nodes.**

- Example: the Versitron SG70660M — 6‑port managed switch (5 RJ‑45 copper 10/100/1000 + 1 SFP fiber) with full web management, VLAN, QoS, port mirroring.   
- Designed for use in automation, IoT, control networks and remote installations where space or port count is constrained.  
- Supports managed features like auto‑negotiation, auto‑MDI/MDI‑X, full wire speed forwarding, and fiber uplinks for longer distances.   
- Ideal for factory floors, SCADA networks, PLC/RTU clusters and similar scenarios requiring a **6‑port managed switch** that delivers enterprise‑class control in a compact footprint.

## 6‑Port Managed PoE Switch for Surveillance Systems

**Power‑over‑Ethernet and managed control combined in a compact switch for cameras.**

- Managed PoE switch variant enables powering IP cameras, access points, and other devices while also providing management visibility and VLAN segmentation. (Versitron offers PoE/PoE+ managed switches in multiple port sizes) :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Compact format (e.g., 6 ports) enables cost‑efficient deployment at edge locations or small surveillance hubs.  
- Offers managed features (VLAN, QoS, port mirroring) to ensure surveillance network traffic can be isolated, prioritised, and monitored effectively.  
- Excellent for video surveillance deployments, parking lots, facility perimeter monitoring, or small‑scale camera clusters requiring a **6‑port managed PoE switch**.
